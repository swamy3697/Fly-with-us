## Overview

The Real-Time Flight Information Dashboard is a web application that provides users with up-to-date information about flights, airports, airlines, and more. It fetches real-time data from the AviationStack API and presents it in a user-friendly interface. This README provides an overview of the application's features, how to use it, and how to contribute.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: The dashboard fetches real-time flight data from the AviationStack API, ensuring that users have access to the latest information.

- **Flight Information**: Detailed information about each flight is displayed, including flight number, airline, flight date, and flight status.

- **Arrival and Departure Details**: Users can view information about both arrival and departure for each flight, including airport, ATA code, ICAO code, terminal, gate, scheduled time, and estimated time.

- **Counters Animation**: Animated counters display statistics such as the total number of flights, airports, airlines, routes, total revenue of the aviation industry, and the number of employees.

- **Navigation**: Users can easily navigate through flight information using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The web page structure is defined using HTML.

- **CSS**: CSS styles the web page to make it visually appealing.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript handles API requests, updates page content dynamically, and enables user interaction.

- **jQuery**: jQuery is used for DOM manipulation and simplifies JavaScript code.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to launch the application.

2. The dashboard will load with initial flight information.

3. Click the "Next" button to view information about the next flight in the list. You can also click "Previous" to go back to the previous flight.

4. Animated counters at the top of the page will display updated statistics as the page loads.

## API Integration

The application integrates with the AviationStack API to fetch flight information. To use this application, you'll need to obtain an API access key from AviationStack. Replace the placeholder `'98c282d15d199bbb52d356a5704483d7'` in the JavaScript code (located in `homePage.js`) with your actual API access key.
